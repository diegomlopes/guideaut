    "ideation14": "For each requirement item, participants will be able to contribute with suggestions on how the interactions (scenarios) of that requirement will be carried out. For example: In the context of an application to teach spatial notions, the requirement “Show left/right concept”, the following idea may arise for an interaction scenario: Introduce the concept of laterality, having a person in the center of the screen as a reference. Show the words left and right next to the person while the person raises their left and right arm accordingly. earnestly.",
    "ideation15": "Taking care of the mirror vision (left of the screen and the left of those facing the screen, for example). Present a soft voice (persona preference) speaking the words left right. During the brainstorming session, new requirements not identified in the previous phase may arise.

Depending on the number of ideas, ask each participant to choose a certain number of ideas. This can be agreed between the participants. The greater the number of ideas, the greater the number of choices. For example, if the list has 10 ideas, each participant can be asked to choose up to 4 ideas, but this will depend on the agreement reached between the participants;\n5. After the selections, the mediator must list the most voted ideas. In case of a tie, it is suggested to discuss whether the tied ideas should be used, or if only one of them. In the latter case, discuss with the participants the best option for the project.",
    "ideation20": "Another way of conducting the idea menu technique is to list the requirements with the respective scenario ideas suggested on a blackboard, asking each participant to make their choices. For each idea to vote put, for example, the value 1 and at the end compute the total number of votes for each idea and take the most voted (according to what was previously defined by the participants). It is important to emphasize that the scenario ideas must be aligned with the profiles defined by the Personas and/or empathy map. If you prefer, the team can use other techniques (instead of the Ideas Menu).",
    "ideation21": "Among them is the Positioning Matrix which, in addition to the Personas, also uses guiding criteria, which can be represented by the restrictions identified in the analysis phase. After such analysis and selection, the main and complementary elements of the selected interaction scenarios are defined. These elements correspond to a breakdown of how the elements that make up the scenario must be presented in the interface to be developed. That is, if the description of the selected scenario mentions an object, in this activity you must define the object (as the main one) and the color or shape of the object (as a complementary one).",
    "ideation22": "As a result of this activity, the list of interface requirements/scenarios must be completed. To this end, a new “round” of brainstorming is suggested, which could be on the same day as activity 3.2.1 or on another day previously agreed with the participants. Figure 19 presents a complete example of completing the Interface Requirements/Restrictions List, whose context is an App for teaching spatial notions and laterality. Below are the suggested procedures for carrying out this activity.",
    "ideation23": "Suggested Procedures:",
    "ideation24": "Choose a moderator, which may be the same as for previous activities. The moderator should present on a blackboard or in printed form, the list of interface scenarios selected in the previous activity, as well as the Personas and the Empathy Map; From each scenario presented, participants will be able to identify the main and complementary elements of the interface scenario.",

    "immersion6": "Procedural suggestions",
    "immersion7": "1. Elaborate the search items (Based on the overview of the application), that is, terms and/or keywords to be used in the desk search that are related to Autism. TIP: If the designer/team does not have any affinity with the Autism theme, it is suggested that the following be included: Concept of autism, levels of autism, forms of communication of an autistic person, main characteristics and limitations of an autistic person, action/reaction of the autistic in relation to the context of the application;",
    "immersion8": "2. Define terms and words that conform to the context of an application. For example, assuming the context of an App to teach laterality (right and left sides), then one should seek information on how the autistic person understands what the right and left side is, what are the main difficulties that an autistic person has to understand what it is left and right side. TIP: In general, regardless of the topic, it is suggested that you always look for questions about what the autistic person likes and dislikes in relation to the proposed topic, what are their difficulties in relation to the proposed topic (app context); and, finally, what types of solutions (other apps for example) already exist for the topic in question, and if this solution has any relation;",
    "immersion9": "3. Define the search sources (books, websites, videos, magazines, blogs of parents and/or specialists in autism, related articles, etc.); Run the search. TIP: Write down the results of the searches in handwritten or typed form, including the source data for a possible need to consult again. For that, something like the example below is suggested.",

It is the moment of conversation with the user, of feeling about what he expects to be delivered. In addition, in this activity, the needs of the system and the characteristics that it must have are perceived. The techniques defined for the Elicit Requirements activity in ProAut are: Interviews and Exploratory Research. In addition, this activity has a sub-activity called Autistic Characterization, which consists of applying the FCA (Autistic Characterization Form), and is carried out during the interview with parents and specialists. The Elicit Requirements activity generates, as artifacts, a set of annotations as well as the completed FCA. These artifacts will serve as input for the next activity (Data Consolidation).

    "immersion12": "Interviews",
    "immersion13": "ProAut contemplates 3 types of interviews, namely: interview with the applicant, interview with caregivers and interview with therapists. The interview with the applicant is mandatory, since it is he who will pass on the needs of the software/Application. A list of questions is available for each type of interview. However, the interviewer need not be limited to this script. That is, just as he may feel the need to ask new questions to complement the answers, he may also fail to ask any.",

    "immersion15": "Interview with Caregivers – the interview with caregivers must be conducted after the interview with the applicant for the application. The reason is that, in possession of the knowledge about the objectives and needs of the application, some questions related to the theme/context of the application are asked. Thus, in this interview, the designer/team should collect information, for example, regarding the social aspects of the autistic, activities that calm/stress, relationship with technologies, among others. The table presents a script to be used for interviewing caregivers:",
    "immersion16": "Interview with therapists – the interview with specialists should also be carried out after the interview with the applicant, for the same reason given for caregivers. In addition, the selection of some specialists is done according to the objectives and needs of the application. For example: an application aimed at education (literacy, teaching mathematics, vowels, etc.) should consider an interview with a pedagogue specializing in autistic education; an application aimed at helping the verbal development of considering an interview with a speech therapist who specializes in autistic care; and so on. In the interview with specialists, the designer/team should collect information, for example, regarding the social aspects of the autistic, activities that calm/stress, relationship with technologies, among others. The following table presents questions to ask therapists:",

Also except for the applicant, explain about filling out the FCA. Since for the specialist, he should respond based on the majority of consultations. For example, in question 25 (walks on tiptoe) the specialist should answer yes (1) if the majority of those assisted have this characteristic;\n8.

The same should be presented at the beginning of interviews with caregivers and therapists. The FCA is a form divided into 4 sections, representing the 4 main areas of limitation of an autistic person, namely: Interaction, Communication, Behavior and Cognition. Each section is made up of a set of characteristics for which the interviewer must mark the value 1, when the child presents the characteristic, and 0 otherwise. Completing the FCA produces a chart called the Autistic Overview Chart (VGA), which allows you to visualize the degree of impairment in each of the areas. So, the higher the percentage of autistic individuals in a given area, the greater the commitment in that area. The figure below presents an example of the VGA, in which it can be seen that the communication area is the most compromised, followed by the areas of interaction and cognition, both with more than 50% of compromise.",

    "immersion37": "Question 1: With the ages obtained in each interview with the parents/guardians, define the age range, taking the lowest age as the lower limit and the highest age as the upper limit. For example, if the ages obtained were 6, 8, 10, and 5 years old, the defined age range will be 5 to 10 years old;",
    "immersion38": "Question 2: State the type of communication: verbal, non-verbal or echolalic verbal (that is, summarize in one of these classifications);",
    "immersion39": "Question 3: Depending on the number of respondents, create an interval with the different series obtained. For example: in the item attending school, if the majority is yes, put the grade interval on the canvas. For example, if a child attends the 3rd, another 4th and another 5th of elementary school, then on the canvas you should put from 3rd to 5th grade of elementary school. If the majority does not attend school, insert “does not attend school” on the canvas;",
    "immersion40": "Question 4: take the different answers and check the one that appears the most. For example, if 2 children live with their parents, 1 with their mother and 1 with their grandmother, transcribe “lives with their parents” onto Canvas, as it represents the majority;",
    "immersion41": "Questions 6 and 7 – Depending on the quantity, put the majority answer. For example: in the item attending school, if the majority is yes, put it.",
    "immersion42": "For the other sections, analyze each response and extract the most relevant information, and map it to the corresponding section, as shown in the figure below.",

    "immersion44": "The mapping of questions asked to experts to the corresponding canvas is shown in the following figure. As with the previous mappings, each question must be mapped in the section according to the numbers presented. For example, questions 1, 2 and 3 for section 1 (Profile) of the ASC, question 4 for section 2 (stereotypies/manias) and so on.",
    "immersion45": "For the Profile section, some remarks:",
    "immersion46": "Question 1: With the ages obtained in each interview, define the age range, taking the lowest age as the lower limit and the highest as the upper limit. For example, if the ages obtained were 6, 8, 10, and 5, the defined age range will be 5 to 10 years old;",
    "immersion47": "Question 2: State the type of communication: verbal, non-verbal or echolalic verbal.",
    "immersion48": "Eliminate conflicts – In a given interview, if an answer that conflicts with another interview is obtained, the one with the highest incidence (number of similar ones) should be used. Example: Suppose that in an interview with a certain mother, this one answers that taking a shower is a stressing activity, and in another interview with another mother, this same answer appears as an activity that calms down. In this case, you should evaluate the highest incidence of responses from respondents (other respondents), or simply choose the one that, in your view and/or experience, is more convenient for the section of the canvas.",
    "immersion49": "Transferring the FCA to the electronic medium – if it has not been possible to use the FCA in the electronic mode, it must be transferred to that mode, so that it is possible to generate the VGA. OBS: It is important to point out that if it is not possible to carry out interviews with parents or specialists, please consult GuideAut."
